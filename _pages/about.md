I am a PhD student at the [Speech, Learning, and the Brain (SLaB) Lab](https://slab-lab.github.io) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Quentin Zhen QIN](https://huma.hkust.edu.hk/people/quentin-z-qin). My PhD study is funded by the prestigious [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) (the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, RGC).

My research focuses on [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics#) and [psycholinguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics). Currently at HKUST, I investigate the fundamental mechanisms of learning and memory from a psycholinguistic perspective. Specifically, I examine how sleep, including both nocturnal sleep and daytime naps, facilitates non-native tone (i.e., [Cantonese tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_phonology#Tones)) learning through memory consolidation in older Mandarin-speaking adults. These projects explore the memory encoding, consolidation, and forgetting in aging brains to develop interventions against memory decline.

Before I began my research journey at HKUST, my linguistic training started during my MA studies. My fascination with Chinese tones began with my first research project, which examined the sound change of lexical tones. While my current work focuses on non-native tone learning, my earlier research explored the production-perception link of native tones. I am also interested in the comparative study of lexical tones across Chinese dialects/languages. To date, I have conducted fieldwork on several Chinese dialects/languages (e.g., [Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Chinese) and [Gan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Chinese) Chinese) multiple times, a challenging yet immensely rewarding experience!
