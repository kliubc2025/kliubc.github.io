I am a PhD student at the Speech, Learning, and the Brain (SLaB) Lab at the [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Quentin Zhen QIN](https://huma.hkust.edu.hk/people/quentin-z-qin). My PhD study is funded by the prestigious [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) (the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, RGC).

Basically, I am interested in phonetics and psycholinguisitcs.
